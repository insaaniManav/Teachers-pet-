# Attendancily

Attendancily is an android application to manage a device which monitors a student's activities.

## How does it operate

A Device is each installed on every student's desk. which consists of a camera. Each device is connected to the teacher's Attendancily application.
```
Our device uses facial recognition to take the daily attendance of the students.
```
```
With the help of our advanced machine learning algorithms we were able to develop a software which can detect 
whether a student is attentive in the class or not.
```
```
The teacher gets updates about the Attendance and the Overall attentiveness of the students in their class, 
on ones Attendancily application and the teacher can improvise on the basis of this information.
```
